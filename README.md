# Product Management App

A simple web-based application for managing products with features like creation, editing, deletion, filtering, and local storage persistence. This app helps users manage product data dynamically and efficiently.

## Features

- Create new products with fields like Name, Price, Category, ID, Taxes, Ads, Discounts, and Count.
- View all products in a table with columns for Name, Price, Category, ID, Taxes, Ads, Discounts, Price After Discount, Total, and Actions.
- Edit product details using a modal popup.
- Delete individual products or all products at once (password-protected).
- Filter products by Name or Category dynamically as you type.
- Persist product data across sessions using localStorage.
- Automatically calculate the total price for each product using the formula:
  ```
  Total = Price - Taxes - Ads + Discounts
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ZEROKU-ZZ/WebSite.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser:

No additional dependencies are required. The app runs entirely in the browser.

## Usage

### Creating a Product
1. Fill out the form fields:
   - Name, Price, Category, and ID are required.
   - Taxes, Ads, and Discounts are optional (default value is 0).
   - Count allows creating multiple products with unique IDs (default value is 1).
2. Click the "Create Product" button to add the product(s) to the table.

### Editing a Product

2. Update the product details in the modal popup.
3. Click "Save Changes" to apply the changes.

### Deleting a Product
1. Click the "Delete" button next to the product you want to remove.
2. Enter the password: `ZAKARIA` to confirm deletion.

### Deleting All Products

2. Enter the password: `ZAKARIA` to confirm deletion of all products.

### Searching for Products

## Password Protection

To ensure data security, certain actions require a password:
- **Deleting a Product**: Enter the password `ZAKARIA` to delete a product.
- **Deleting All Products**: Enter the password `ZAKARIA` to clear all products from the table.

If the password is incorrect, the action will be canceled, and an alert will notify you.
